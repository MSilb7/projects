<!-- The Dai stablecoin is a decentralized, unbiased, collateral-backed cryptocurrency
soft-pegged to the US Dollar. Dai is held in cryptocurrency wallets or within
platforms, and is supported on Ethereum and other popular blockchains.

Dai is easy to generate, access, and use. Users generate Dai by depositing collateral
assets into Maker Vaults within the Maker Protocol. This is how Dai is entered into
circulation and how users gain access to liquidity. Others obtain Dai by buying it
from brokers or exchanges, or simply by receiving it as a means of payment.
